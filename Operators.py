# Arithmetic Operators 
print(10+2)         # Addition
# O/p - 12 

print(10-2)         # Subtraction   
# O/p - 8

# O/p - 20

# O/p - 5.0

# Coparison Operator
print(3>2)    # It'll return true or false 
# O/p - true

# Logical Operators 
# Three types - 1) Logical and  , 2) Logical or  ,  3)Logical not

# Logical and
print(1<3 and 3>4)   # It'll check for second if first condition is true otherwise no
# if both the conditions are true it'll return True otherwise False

# Logical or
print(1<3 or 3>4)   # It'll check for second if first condition is false
# if first condition is true it'll return True else it'll check second condition 
# it'll return true if anyone(or both) of the condition is true 

# Logical not
print(1<3)          # True
print(not 1<3)      # False
